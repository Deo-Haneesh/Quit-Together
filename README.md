## 🌟 What is Quit-Together?

**Quit-Together** is a revolutionary social wellness platform designed to help individuals overcome addiction and stress through the power of community support, gamification, and AI companionship. Unlike traditional social media that often contributes to mental health issues, Quit-Together is built with one purpose: **to heal**.

Whether you're quitting smoking, overcoming substance addiction, managing stress, or building healthier habits, Quit-Together provides a safe, supportive space where every interaction is designed to help you succeed.

## 📖 Our Journey: From Idea to Reality

### 🎯 The Vision (December 2025)

It all started with a simple question: *"What if social media could actually help people instead of harming them?"*

Addiction and mental health struggles affect millions worldwide, yet most platforms do little to address these issues. We envisioned a platform where:
- Every feature promotes wellness, not addiction
- Community support replaces toxic comparison
- Games heal instead of distract
- AI companions provide 24/7 support

### 🔨 The Build (December 2025 - January 2026)

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Set up React + Vite for blazing-fast performance
- Designed the dark-mode-first, glassmorphic UI
- Integrated Firebase for real-time backend services

**Week 3-4: Core Features**
- Built the social feed with posts, stories, and reactions
- Created the streak tracking system for accountability
- Implemented user profiles with badges and achievements

**Week 5-6: Gamification**
- Developed therapeutic games:
  - 🧠 **Memory Match** - Cognitive exercise
  - 🫧 **Bubble Pop** - Stress relief
  - 🌱 **Gratitude Garden** - Positive reinforcement
  - 🧘 **Zen Garden** - Meditation space

**Week 7-8: AI & Polish**
- Integrated Tyler, our AI companion for support
- Added smooth animations and page transitions
- Optimized performance for lag-free experience
- Implemented notifications and messaging systems

### 🚀 Launch (January 2026)

Today, Quit-Together stands as a fully functional platform ready to make a difference. Our journey taught us that technology, when built with purpose, can truly change lives.
